# Calculator by JavaScript Alerts

A simple web-based calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, where all user interactions and results are handled through `alert()` dialogs. This project is a minimalist implementation that showcases basic arithmetic operations using JavaScript’s `prompt()` and `alert()` functions — no UI elements or buttons involved.

## ✨ Features

* User inputs collected via `prompt()`
* Results displayed using `alert()`
* Supports:

  * Addition
  * Subtraction
